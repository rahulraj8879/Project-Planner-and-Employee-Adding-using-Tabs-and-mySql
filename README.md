You need to have mysql installed and rnning with database schema name " projectplanner" and it should have 2 tables in it
one table named "employee" 
second table named "project"
column names for both can be seen in design view of both tabs and for date timepicker i have used "Datetime" type of mysql
rest all columns are of varchar datatye with name colm having varchar(100) and others varchar(45)
don.t forget to change connection string below with your mysql " servername;uid;port;pwd;databaseName "
